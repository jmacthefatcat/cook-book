You want your crumble topping to be on the doughier side. If you find it's still pretty "dusty" or simply still resembles flour,  add more butter. 

Your apples should also pile up and ideally higher than your baking dish. If you use 5-6 apples and they don't rise higher than the pan, try finding a smaller dish to bake the crumble in. 

Pecans and Walnuts make a nice garnish when serving.
