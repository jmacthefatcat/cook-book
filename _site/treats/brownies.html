              <li>1/3 cup Flour</li>
              
              <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
              
              <li>1 pinch of Salt</li>
              
              <li>2 pinches of Sugar</li>
              
              <li>1 Egg</li>
              
              <li>1 tbsp Melted Butter</li>

            <ul class="stack">
              
              <li>Take your pan, preferably non-stick, and start getting it hot. You can start the heat low and slowly melt your butter while you continue with the recipe.</li>
              
              <li>In a bowl combine your Flour, Sugar, and Salt. Then add in your Egg and only about 2-3 tbsps of your 1/2 cup of Milk. Mix thorughly until your batter is nice and smooth, if it's not mixing well you can add a bit more Milk.</li>
              
              <li>Once you have a nice smooth batter mix in the rest of the Milk and your Butter.</li>
              
              <li>Your pan should be pretty hot by now. You want the Crepe to cook quickly but not burn, I find usually leaving the heat a little over medium works.</li>
              
              <li>You don't need a lot of batter, you just want enough to cover the bottom of the pan you are using, this may take some time figuring out, have fun. (Measuring cups with spouts are handy here.)</li>
              
              <li>You want to pour your batter off center in the pan and swirl the batter around the edge, then bring it down across the middle. You have to move quick, but you don't need to panic.</li>
              
              <li>It will only need about a minute on each side, you want some nice browning and you will soon gain a preference as to how much.</li>
              
              <li>A fork, egg flipper, turner, or similar works well to flip your Crepe or just use the pan to flip it, hot shot.</li>
              
              <li>Once flipped cooked for 45-60 seconds or to preference.</li>
              
              <li>Spread or place something delicious on your Crepe then roll it up how you see fit, then consume.</li>
