This particular marinade is nice and tangy. If you want to cut back on the tangy taste, half the vinegar amount and match it with brown sugar, so 1/4 cup Vinegar becomes 2 tbsps Vinegar and 2 tbsps Brown Sugar.

When cooking your meat, you can take the used marinade and use it to flavour gravy or even just toss it all in a pot and mix in some cornstarch over heat to turn it directly into a sauce.
