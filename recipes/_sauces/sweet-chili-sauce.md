title: Sweet Chili Sauce
picture: chili-sauce
ingredients:
- 5 chili peppers (whatever kind you want)
- chili flakes (if you want to use sweeter fresh peppers then add some heat)
- 5 garlic cloves
- 225ml white vinegar
- 125 ml water
- 5g salt
- 200g white sugar
steps:
- Combine everything except the sugar in a blender (or food processor or immersion blender) and blend until you have your desired consistency (how lumpy you want the sauce)
- Empty mixture into a pot and add in the sugar. Bring to a boil then simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to tighten up a bit and meld together.
- You can thicken with cornstarch if you need it thick and fast, but the sauce will naturally thicken as it cools. 
- Pour into appropriate container, label, and store in fridge.
