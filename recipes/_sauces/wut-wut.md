title: wut-wut sauce
picture: wut-wut
ingredients:
- 10g chili peppers (roughly 5)
- 40g green onions, whites only (roughly 8)
- 25g peeled ginger
- 6 garlic cloves
- 60ml sesame oil
- 300ml veg oil
- 15ml dijon
- 15ml lemon juice
- 60ml soy sauce
- 30ml honey
steps:
- slice/cut up your peppers, onions, ginger, and garlic into fine-ish pieces,doesn't have to be perfect because we will blend everything later. Move to a large bowl that can tolerate high heat.
- combine then heat oils to 300F, pour over the veg in the bowl. Careful as it will cause a ruckus and for a moment double in volume as the water evaporates out.
- let cool then strain the oil into something with a spout for easy pouring later.
- in the bowl or in a blender, combine all the veg, plus dijon, lemon juice, soy sauce, and honey. Blend that shit.
- while still blending, slowly pour the oil back in so it can combine and emulsify.
- enjoy

This is my take on Cassie Youngs(sp?) wet-wet sauce. Very similar, except I add dijon, lemon juice, remove hoision, and blend everything in the end so I can just squeezie it.
