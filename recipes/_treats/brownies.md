Brownie MUST rest for two hours after coming out of the oven. Deal with it. After 40 mins if you check the brownie with a toothpick you may still get some batter residue on the stick, that's okay, the brownie will continue to cook for a bit on the counter so slightly undercooked works in our favour.
