picture: no-image
ingredients:
- 2 cups sugar
- .75 oz gelatin
- 2/3 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup water
steps:
- pour 1/4 cup of water in mixing bowl and sprinle the gelatin powder on top, set aside.
- in a pot combine sugar, maple syrup, and 1/2 cup of water. 
- Continue to cook sugar mixture until it reaches 240F
- Start whipping the gelatin and water on high and slowly pour in the sugar mixture
- Keep whipping until doubled in size then check consistency, when you raise the whisk out of the bowl and the mixture falls back into the bowl, you want it to stay piled up before it slowly sinks into the mixture.
- When done transfer to a hotel pan or whatever lined with saran wrap covered in icing sugar or cornstarch to avoid sticking.
- let set at room temp for at least 12 hours.
