picture: chocolate-chip-cookies
ingredients:
- 90g brown sugar
- 80g white sugar
- 100g butter
- 1 egg
- 10ml vanilla
- 1g salt
- 1g baking soda
- 170g ap flour
- chocolate chips
steps:
- Preheat oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper
- In a bowl, add in sugars and butter and cream until nice and smooth. If using a stand mixer you cream with a paddle, not a whisk.
- Add in egg, mix, add in vanilla, mix, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this.
- After flour has been incorporated fold in your desired amount of chocolate chips and yes there is a limit, too many chocolate chips will stop the batter from cooking evenly so calm the fuck down. 
- 13 mins seems to be the magic number with our oven.
- Let cool, then enjoy.

If no butter, coconut oil can be substituted in a 1:1 ratio.
Makes about 12 cookies, half the batch for a quick 6 cookies and before you ask, crack the egg into a bowl, whisk and then only use half, there ya go, half an egg.
Also 1g of baking soda is half a tsp for those who love the american imperial system.
