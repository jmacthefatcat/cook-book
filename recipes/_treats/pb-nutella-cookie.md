title: Peanut Butter and Nutella Cookies
picture: pb-nutella
ingredients:
- 1/2 cup Peanut Butter
- 1/2 cup Granulated Sugar
- 1 Egg (No Yolk, just the White)
- 2 tbsps Nutella
steps:
- Preheat Oven to 350Â°.
- In a bowl mix together the Peanut Butter, Granulated Sugar, and the Egg White. Mix well, until everything is nice and combined, smooth as you can get it champ.
- Now add in 1 tbsp of Nutella and mix breifly, apparently it's suppose to look like the Nutella is like a ripple in the dough or something. I assume it's for aesthetics because mine just kind of turned into a dark brown blob and tasted fine. Jess has informed me that you need to FOLD the nutella into the mix. So chop, turn, chop, turn.
- On a greased baking sheet use a spoon and scoop out some dough, size is up to you just make sure you give the cookies space on the sheet.
- Depending on size you will want to bake for 10 - 15 minutes, you can tell by looking at the edges, you want a nice brown edge.
- Remove from oven and look cool for 10 minutes before removing from tray.
- Consume.

Makes about 6 - 8 cookies. Good for a couple people or just one, I understand.
