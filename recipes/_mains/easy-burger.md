If you like your steaks medium rare aim to make thicker patties and cook for about 4 minutes on each side on the BBQ. For those who prefer their meat well done, do not make large patties, you will dry out and ruin the patty waiting for the insides to cook, simply make smaller thinner patties, then double up on them if you want a thick patty that's well done.

Lettuce and Tomato are classic toppings, pickle isn't bad either but when dressing your burger - less can be more. You want to end up with something you can manage with a firm grip in one hand or comfortably with two hands without losing your innards after a couple of bites. For me the crucial topping is the cheese. Real cheddar or mozzarella slices may seem like the premium/quality/healthy choice to go, but the truth is nothing melts as perfectly as kraft (or off brand) processed cheese slices.

If you want your burgers to keep their shape, make them a day ahead and keep them in the fridge.
