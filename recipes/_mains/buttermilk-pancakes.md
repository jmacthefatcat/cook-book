Unless you have a flat-top, a small frying pan with some butter doing one pancake at a time will give you nice consistent pancakes at the cost of a little extra time spent by the stove.

When adding any toppings you'll get the best results mixing them into the batter, be it blueberries, chocolate chips, nuts, or mashed up bananas.
