- Burger fixin's (bun, lettuce, tomato, etc)
steps:
- Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix together well, hands always work best.
- Separate into preferred sized balls (You can keep a consitent size if you use a measuring cup, I find 1/3 makes a nice patty) and flatten either using your fingers, a burger press, or even a lid from a decent sized jar. Make sure you use wax paper when using another item to flatten your burgers because food safety.
- Cook using a BBQ or oven at 400Â° or pan fry. Thinner patties usually only take 2 minutes per side and 4 minutes perside for thicker patties

The thing with ground beef is that it's not the same as cooking a steak in regards to the internal temperature. You can eat a burger medium rare like you would a steak, but the issue is that a steak is a cut from one animal and ground beef is multiple sources of beef ground together through a machine. This causes a higher chance of bacteria and contamination, meaning it's technically much safer to eat a steak medium rare than a wad of ground beef. This can be easily navigated by taking note of the thickness of your patty, so it cooks properly but you don't dry the patty out, cause that's just cruel, so here's my rule of thumb: If your meat must be well done, make thinner patties, say 1/4-inch thick, cook for two minutes on each side and slap a couple of those bad boys on your bun. If you prefer your steak medium rare, make thicker patties, say little over 1/2 an inch thick, and cook 3 - 4 minutes on each side. They won't be pink, but pretty close. Full serving of tasty, hold the dash to the bathroom.

Burger toppings are up to you, just make sure you can hold the damn thing nicely in one hand and your innards don't spill out and all over the damn place when you take a bite. I am opinionated though on the type of cheese you use. I know real cheddar, mozzarella, swiss, wtfever tastes better and are healthy options, but I will always choose processed american cheese slices, NOTHING melts so nasty like those kraft cheese slices. Fight me. 

If you want your burgers to keep their shape, make them a day ahead and keep them in the fridge.
