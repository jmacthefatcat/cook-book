ingredients:
- Pasta noodles (typically spaghetti)
- 1/2 a pack of bacon
- 2 - 3 cloves of garlic

- 3 eggs
steps:
- Start your water for your pasta
- Dice up your bacon, crack open your garlic cloves and cook with the bacon in a frying pan
- Beat the eggs in a bowl and add your cheese (The finer the shred the better, grated works best)
- When spaghetti is done, remove garlic from bacon and turn heat to low.
- Add spaghetti to the bacon using tongs straight from the pasta water and keep moving it around until it stops sizzling
- Set aside some of the pasta water, adding 1/4 cup to your pasta and bacon now, keep stirring
- Next add the egg and cheese mixture
- Keep stirring and add your parsley/cilantro
- stir about more until sauce is a little creamy then serve

Adding whole button mushrooms to the pan while you cook your bacon is a nice little add-on and helps replicate meatballs. You can also mince your garlic if you wanted to and skip the removal step.

I have yet to master this stupid delicious dish, will add more info when I can.
