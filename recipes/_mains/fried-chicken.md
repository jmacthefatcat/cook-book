title: Fried Chicken Sandwiches
picture: fried-chicken
ingredients:
- Chicken (thighs preferred)
- Buttermilk 
- 1/2 cup Flour
- 1/2 tbsp Tumeric
- 1/2 tbsp Cumin
- 1/2 tbsp Ground Corriander
- 1/2 tbsp Cinnamon
- 1/2 tbsp Ginger
- 1/2 tbsp Paprika
- 1/2 tsp Cayenne
- Preferred sandwich fixin's (brioche bun, mustard, hot sauce, jalapenos, pickles, tomato, lettuce, etc.)
steps:
- Put your chicken in a container with enough buttermilk that the chicken is submerged, cover and let sit in fridge for at least 8 hours (save yourself a hassle and just do it the night before you are going to have it, it can sit in the Marinade for a couple days if need be, I haven't noticed any downfalls yet and I've had it sit for 3+ days)
- Start heating your oil/set your frier to 350Â°
- Now mix your flour and all of your spices in a bowl. I find that deep but not overly wide bowls are best, you can drop your Chicken in and the high walls help keep the mess in and the lack of width allow you to easily burry the Chicken in your mix so it gets completely covered. Press down on the chicken and flatten it in the mix, you want all the little crevices covered in flour too.
- When your oil/frier is ready shake off excess flour and place your Chicken into the frier/oil, do not crowd the thing, be it air frier or deep frier. Let it do it's thang. Usually I find my Chicken thighs are at or just shy of 165Â° after 5 minutes. So check your meat with a thermometer after 5 mins and go from there
- When your Chicken is done place it on a paper towel to help soak up excess oil or if you have a strainer place chicken in that over sink for a minute. Now place on your plate or your bun and enjoy

Ideally you want your Chicken to marinate over night, but I think you get decent results after 8 hours, so if you can do it the night before awesome, if you forget and can do it in the morning (say 8:00am) they would be worthwhile to eat for supper (say 6:00pm). You don't have to use Chicken thighs, you could use filets or breasts, but I find thighs are cheapest and are usually a good size to eat in a sandwich or on it's own.

This recipe gives steps for deep frying. You can cook these in an oven if you wish at 350Â°. It will probably take 30 - 45 minutes depending on size of the Chicken, but of course use a thermometer to make sure the Chicken hits 165Â°. For the oven though, I remember being told to coat the dredged chicken (your chicken covered in flour and spices) in melted butter then place on a baking sheet and into the oven. I have yet to try this, but there ya go. ðŸ¤· 

Also, because this always annoys me, Marinade is a noun and refers to the soaking sauce, where marinate is a verb and refers to the ACTION of using a soaking sauce. So you make a Marinade to marinate your meat. ðŸ™„

Also-also, (I know this is starting to look like a fucking blog post recipe where you have to read a novella before you find out the stupid recipe, but stay with me please) seasoning food is obviously very important, but you also don't want to overseason something. With this recipe I purposely ONLY season my dregde, and I season it well. That being said adding spices to your Buttermilk Marinade is a thing (fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, some garlic, and of course, salt), rubbing salt and pepper on it before you dredge is a thing, but for ease I make sure my flour mix does the seasoning for me. I also want to point out that the main purpose of a brine or marinade is to help the meat retain moisture. Salt in a brine or the Lactic Acid in milk helps open the protein fibers up (I think that's what it's doing) and retain moisture. Added flavours are just a tasty bonus.
