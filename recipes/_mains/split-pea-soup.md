title: Split Pea Soup
picture: split-pea-soup
ingredients:
- 2 cups Split Peas
- Pork, be it pickled, whole ham bone, whatever
- 2 Onions
- 1 large Carrot
- 2 Celery stalks 
- 1 tbsp fresh Thyme
- 1 tsp Cayenne
- 1/2 tbsp Salt
- 1/2 tbsp Pepper
- 1 tbsp Paprika
- 1 tbsp Brown Sugar
- 2 tbsps Lemon juice
- 6 to 8 cups of Stock (any kind)
steps:
- Take your 2 cups of split peas and place them in your dutch oven or whatever you wish to cook your soup in. Add in enough water so your peas are covered by about 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, cover and remove from heat. Your peas will need to sit for at least 2 hours, potentailly 4. You want them fairly tender, but they don't need to be mush.
- Next you want to add in your stock, vegetables, ham, and any other fixin's. Bring back to a boil then cover and simmer for about an hour and a half (If you aren't using a ham bone then you essentially want to make sure your ham is cooked and your veggies are at your desired tenderness) then remove the ham bone. While the meat cools continue to let your soup simmer uncovered.
- When you can, remove the meat from the bone and dice it. If you wish you could use a hand blender to blend your Onion, Carrot, and Celery into your soup for a nice smooth texture. Add your ham back in and continue to simmer for 5 - 10 minutes, remove from heat and stir in 2 - 4 tbsps of cream to finish.
