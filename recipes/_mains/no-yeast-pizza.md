title: No Yeast Pizza
picture: no-yeast-pizza
ingredients:
- 2 cups Flour
- 2 tsp of Baking Powder
- 1 tsp Salt
- 3/4 cup of Water
- 1/4 cup of Oil
- Whatever you want for toppings
- 1 can Plum Tomatoes
- 1 tsp Thyme
- 1 tsp Oregano
- 1 tsp Sugar
- 1 tsp Garlic Powder
steps:
- Preheat oven to 425Â°
- Ready your choice of toppings
- To make your Pizza Sauce open your can of Tomatoes and grab a bowl and a mesh strainer, then another bowl. Take your Tomatoes, a couple at a time, and blend them in the bowl without the strainer, again be gentle, you just want it nice and chunky, not pulverized. Pour that into the strainer and keep repeating until all Tomatoes are done. Now use a spoon to press on the chunks to squeeze more juice out, leaving a nice chunky sauce in the strainer and juice in the bottom bowl. Save the juice if you want and move the blended Tomatoes to another bowl and mix with your Thyme, Oregano, Sugar, and Garlic. 
- In a seperate bowl mix Flour, Baking Powder, and Salt together with a fork
- Then add in your water, stir a bit with fork, add in oil, continue to stir with fork until ingredients start to incorporate.
- Now, using your hands, start mixing the dough together and form a ball, split it in half and place on a floured table.
- Continue kneading your dough, pushing down in the middle to slowly form a pizza
- Use a rolling pin if you have one, start in the middle and push to the edges, but never go over and flatten your edges.
- It's up to you how wide, thick, etc you want your pizza dough, when it's finished place on a baking sheet then slap on some sauce and toppings. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes and then check where it's at. I find myself usuallly going for 18 minutes.
