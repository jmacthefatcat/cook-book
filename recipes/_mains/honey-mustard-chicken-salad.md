title: Chicken and Lettuce
picture: honey-mustard-salad
ingredients:
- Cooked chicken, sliced or shredded
- Preferred type of lettuce for salad bed
- Red onion, finely sliced (diced celery is a good alternative if not a fan of red onion)
- 1 apple, sliced (a pear or halved grapes are good alternatives)
- Pecans and Walnuts (or whatever nuts you prefer)
- Salad dressing
steps:
- First take your precooked chicken and either shred it or slice it, then slowly heat it up with a bit of oil in a frying pan, low heat, you just want to warm the chicken up, not dry it out, use a lid if you can.
- In a bowl toss apples, onion, nuts, and chicken in salad dressing
- In another (preferably larger) bowl place your preferred salad bed and lightly toss in a small amount of dressing
- Now toss your lettuce and toppings together then serve, you can garnish with some parmesan or whatever you like, I'm not your mother

I'm not a fan of adding chicken to a caeser salad, fish makes way more sense to me and I don't think meat should really be in a mixed green or house salad, but I don't necessarily hate the idea of chicken and lettuce if done in a way that makes sense. The key here is using a dressing that actually goes with your chicken (check sauces for curry or honey mustard dressing) and using toppings you would typically find in a waldorf salad or an actual chicken salad, but ditching the mayonnaise based dressing.

One of the key things to do with making any salad is to dress the lettuce just before you add your toppings.
