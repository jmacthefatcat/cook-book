title: Pasta and Spinach
picture: pasta-spinach
ingredients:
- Pasta of choice
- 2 strips Bacon, diced
- 1 cup Spinach, chopped roughly
- 1 small Onion, diced
- 3 cloves Garlic
- 1/4 cup Stock/Broth
- 1/2 tbsp Flour
- 1/2 tbsp Oil
- 1 tsp or so for each of your desired herbs (I typically just use thyme)
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Pepper
- 1/2 tsp Hot Pepper flakes
steps:
- Get a decent sized frying pan nice and hot. Toss in your diced bacon and let it cook until it starts to get brown.
- Toss in your onions, turn heat down a bit, and continue to cook. 
- In a small bowl or shot glass even mix together your flour and oil.
- Turn your heat down to med-low and in your roux (flour + oil mix) stir trying to cover your onions and bacon and let cook for 5 mins. 
- Next add in your spices and cook for two minutes.
- Now add in the Stock/Broth and give it a good stir making sure to scrap all the bits from the bottom of your pan. It should start to turn intoa sauce pretty quick and start to thicken, add in garlic and turn temp down to low.
- Get your pasta water boiling. Cook Pasta until Al Dente.
- Dump your Spinach on top of the sauce then using a slotted spoon, scoop your Pasta out and onto your Spinach and mix well. Let sit for a couple of minutes for things to meld togetether.
- Serve with Parmesean for garnish.

If you use longer Pasta, like Spaghetti, I wouldn't bother chopping up your Spinach. 

With Pasta dishes I usually get my pot of water ready at the start and place it on a burner set to med - med-low and by the time the sauce is under way it won't take long for my Pasta water to come to a boil, but with this dish I usually don't bother until after my Bacon is done.
