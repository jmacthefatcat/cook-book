picture: mac-and-cheese
ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups of small pasta
- 1 1/2 tbsp of butter
- 1 1/2 tbsp of flour
- 1 1/2 cups of milk
- 1/2 tsp of cayenne
- 1/2 tsp of paprika
- 1/2 tsp of mustard powder
- 1/2 tsp of worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 tsp of salt
- 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup of shredded parmesean cheese (set aside half for garnish)
- 1/4 cup of shredded mozzerella (set aside half for garnish)
steps:
- Start boiling your water for your pasta.
- In another saucepan starting heating your butter and flour on medium heat. At this step you are creating your roux, make sure your butter and flour is nice and mixed and leave it to simmer for 5-7 minutes.
- Next you want to add in your milk. On medium - medium-high heat keep whisking your milk and roux together. This will take a bit, you want your milk to come to a slight boil and you want it to reduce to a thickness of a cream.
- Toss in your spices and Worcestershire and give that shit a stir.
- Next add in your cheese and keep whisking so it melts and incorporates nicely.
- At some point your pasta should have been cooked and strained. When all your cheese is mixed in and in your pasta and give it a nice mix.
- Pour into bowls and garnish with leftover cheese.

Cheddar is king when it comes to this dish. If you can only have one type of cheese, I would recommend cheddar, that being said I'm not your mother and you can use whatever cheeses your heart desires.

Despite the name being Macaroni and Cheese, I find myself preferring small shell pasta instead - which you can see in the picture below.
