title: Pasta and Tomato Sauce
picture: pasta-tomato
ingredients:
- Pasta of choice
- 1 can of Plum Tomatoes
- 1 clove of Garlic (or more if your into that), minced
- 1/2 tbsp fresh Thyme, chopped finely
- 1/2 tbsp fresh Oregano, chopped finely
- 1/2 tbsp of Lemon Juice
- 1 tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 - 2 tbsps of Brown Sugar (your call on the sweetness, but you need something to balance out the acidity from the Tomatoes)
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Pepper
- 1/2 pound of Ground Beef
- 1 Small Onion, sliced 
- Basil, chiffonade for garnish
- Parmesean, for garnish
steps:
- Crack open that can of Tomatoes. Using a hand blender gently blend a couple Tomatoes at a time to a chunky mixture, do not obliterate the Tomatoes please, next place the blended chunks in a mesh strainer over a bowl. Once you've blended all the Tomatoes and the chunks are now in a strainer, use a spoon to gently push down on the chunks releasing the juices into the bowl below. Ideally when you are done you will have a nice chunky mix of Tomatoes in the strainer and some nice Tomato juice in the bowl. Place the juice in one container, the chunks in another.
- Now in a bowl (you can use the bowl you strained the Tomato juice into) take about half of your chunky tomato and mix it with about a 1/4 cup of your Tomato juice. Next mix in your Garlic, Thyme, Oregano, Lemon Juice, Worcestershire Sauce, Brown Sugar, Salt, and Pepper. Taste, adjust as you see fit then set aside.
- Take your ground beef and season it with some salt and pepper. Now either you can roll it into cute little meat balls if you want or just leave it, your call boo.
- Now there is a couple of ways to do this, but for my meat what I'll do is get my pan nice and hot, be it for meatballs or just ground meat, and cook the meat until nice and brown, I then remove the meat from the pan and set it aside. I don't worry if there is a little bit of grease in my frying pan, but if there is a lot I would dump it or most of it.
- Now cut your heat and toss the onions in the pan, I cook them until they start to change colour. I then add in my Tomato sauce and bring the pan up to medium heat. Once it starts to simmer (or boil if you walked away) I cut the heat back and let it simmer so it can reduce/thicken.
- While the sauce is simmering I start my (SALTED) pasta water and bring it to a boil quickly. Add your pasta and cook until Al Dente (slight crunch in the middle) then straight from the pasta water using tongs or a pasta ladle move your pasta into your sauce and start stirring and tossing so everything has been mixed and your pasta is fully coated.
- I let it sit for a minute or two after it's been tossed so it can meld together and reduce a bit more, but overal this is up to you.
- Scoop into bowl and garnish with Basil and Parmesean.
