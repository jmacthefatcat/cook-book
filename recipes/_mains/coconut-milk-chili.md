Garnish with some salt and pepper, shredded cheese, and herbs like cilantro, basil, and parsley.

If you have the time, which you should as chili isn't typically a quick meal, you can cook your bacon whole in the oven then dice it oppose to dicing it raw then frying it with the ground beef. You also don't have to wait for the bacon to be done to move onto the next step, just add the bacon to the chili when it's done.
