title: Breakfast Sandwich
picture: breakfast-sandwich
ingredients:
- 2 slices of Bacon
- Ground Beef
- Salt
- Pepper
- Cheese
- Slice of Tomato
- 1 Egg
- English Muffin bun
- BBQ Sauce
steps:
- Quick and easy, season your Ground Beef with Salt and Pepper and mix well (feel free to add other spices, Paprika is nice) then scoop into 1/4 measuring cups, then flatten into a nice flat platty. Set aside. 
- Oven to 400Â°. When ready place your bacon on a tray and set a timer for 15 minutes, At 15 minutes add your patties to your baking tray and take your  bacon out (or leave it in if you want it crispier). You will only need to cook those thin patties for about a minute on each side. 
- Now get your pan going for your egg. You can fry your egg however you please, but keep in mind it's a sandwich and runny yolks on a sandwich is just messy, you look foolish, really, but cook your egg how you like it.
- When your egg is done, lay your two strips of bacon on top of the egg, then your cheese slice, then your tomato. Let the heat from the frying pan melt the cheese to bind everything together. If you need to add some heat go for it, covering your pan will also help.
- On your english muffin bun (toasted or not) lay down some bbq sauce (top AND bottom) then place your patty on the bottom bun, then place your Egg-Bacon-Cheese-Tomato work of art on top of that.
- Close sandwich and consume you handsome devil you.

I fucking love runny yolk, I'm sayin' Sunny Side Up for life, but I can not endorse it on a sandwich. It just becomes a mess, not in the same way Eggs Bene becomes a mess, the bad kind of mess, the server is debating getting you a trough and bib kind of mess, your significant other hides in the bathroom until you are done kind of mess. Keep those kind of messes for the bedroom please and just get your egg well done.
