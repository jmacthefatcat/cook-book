For reference soak dry Chick Peas over night in enough water to cover them by 2 inches. Then bring them to a boil (again in enough water to cover by 2 inches) then cover and let simmer for 20 - 40 minutes, until there nice and tender really. Also found out you don't need to soak them overnight, you can just boil them, though they will take significantly longer. Plus when checking if they are done, you just blow on one, if it peels, it's done. ðŸ¤·
