picture: stuffed-mushrooms
ingredients:
- 12 Mushrooms
- 3 Garlic Cloves
- 2 tbsp of Oil
- 1/2 cup of Cream Cheese
- 1/4 tsp of Cayenne
- 1/4 cup Grated or shredded Cheese
- Salt and Pepper
steps:
- Preheat oven to 350°
- Destem and wash or wipe Mushrooms off if dirty
- Mince the Garlic Cloves and Mushroom stems
- Heat oil in pan and sauté your minced Garlic and Mushroom stems together, about 5 minutes, nice and fragrant
- In a separate bowl combine Cream Cheese, Cayenne, Salt, Pepper, and Grated cheese, don't worry about mixing yet
- When your Garlic and Mush is nice and heated add to your bowl of cheese and spices and now mix, the heat will make it much easier to do so. Make sure mixture is nice and blended together. It won't be runny, but you want something you can easily spread
- Using a spoon or a piping bag, stuff those Mushroom caps
- On a baking sheet of your choice place in the oven for 10 minutes (if you want to still have a little mushroom pop) or 15 (for softer caps)
- Let cool for a minute or two then eat

Shredded cheese works, grated cheese is simply easier to mix. Asiago and Parmesan are good choices, but it's up to you.

A spoon works, but a piping bag makes it much easier, if you don't have an actual piping bag, you can use a little ziploc bag and cut the corner off.
