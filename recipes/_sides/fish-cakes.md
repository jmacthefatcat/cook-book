title: Fish Cakes
picture: no-image
ingredients:
- 3 Fish fillets (preferably whitefish like cod)
- Lemon Juice
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- 1 Onion, diced
- 1 cup Peas
- 3 Potatoes
- 1/4 cup Milk
- 2 tbsps Butter
- 2 tsp Salt
- 2 tsp Pepper
- 2 or 3 eggs
- Bread Crumbs
steps:
- Okay, let's start by getting our Peas and Onions out of the way. 
- You want to saut√© your onions, so frying pan down on a med-high burner, splash of oil, wait a minute, toss your onions in and move them around, then sprinkle some salt. You want to brown your onions, when they look nice remove them from the pan and set to the side. If you find that your onions are stuck to your pan use some wine or balsamic vinegar (you don't need a lot) to deglaze the pan while it's still hot and add that to your onions.
- The Peas we are going to blanch. So get a pot of water boiling. When it starts to boil, dump your Peas in. While it comes back to a boil ready another bowl with cold water. When Peas start to boil again, wait 2-3 minutes then strain them and dump them in the cold water. I usually strain them again and put them back in the bowl with fresh cold water. Let them sit for 5 mins, then remove and let sit in a strainer to dry. 
- Okay, peel and chop up your Potatoes. We are going to mash them so they don't have to be pretty just make sure all the pieces are the same size so they cook evenly. Grab a pot, cover the pieces in water, and boil them.
- While the Potatoes are going we can poach the Fish. So fill either a pot or large frying pan with enough water that it's obviously going to cover the fish. Crack open your garlic cloves and toss them in with a couple squirts of lemon juice, then some salt. Heat to high to bring it to a boil then drop it down to medium and add in your fish. Just let that simmer and do it's thang. It won't take too long for the fish to cook, you'll see it start to turn white and fluff up a bit, at this point you could turn the heat off and just let it keep cooking if you don't think it's done, if it is take the fish out and set aside.
- When your Potatoes have boiled enough to be pretty soft, drain them and start mashing. Toss in your salt, pepper, milk, and 1 tbsp Butter for now and mix. Add in your second tbsp of butter and more milk if you feel the potatoes could be creamier.
- Now that you have cooked Fish, Peas, Onions, and Mashed Potatoes, you can mix it all together in a bowl. Now roll your mixture into balls. Your choice on size but I would lean to smaller balls. If you need a reference, scoop your mixture into a 1/3 cup and use that.
- After you've got your balls, heh, I tend to set them in the fridge for an hour to help them stay together. 
- Now you want to crack your eggs into a bowl and whisk them. This is an egg wash, you are going to coat your balls in this, then roll them in bread crumbs, so I find a small bowl allows you to cover more of your Fish Cake ball while using less egg. 
- So, with your egg wash bowl and now a plate covered in bread crumbs, dunk your Fish Cake ball in the egg wash and move it around, covering the whole thing, now move it to your Bread Crumb plate and roll it around so it covers completely, when covered you want to now squish the ball so it forms into a cake shape. If it's easier you can press it into cake form when you first place it on the plate and flip it around in the bread crumbs. Whatever works.
- Now when it comes time to serve them you can use a frying pan and oil to cook up and brown the bread crumbs creating a nice shell, you can do so with the oven, or my preferred method, a quick deep fry.

I will hone in on more exact measurements later, but I think this is pretty close. I usually try to use as many Potatoes as I have Fish Fillets, but I've also made some really nice fish cakes using the cheaper option in some stores of buying the cod trimmings. They aren't pretty but that doesn't matter for these cakes.
