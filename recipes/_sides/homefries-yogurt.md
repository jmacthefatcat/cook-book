title: Homefries and Yogurt
picture: homefries-yogurt
ingredients:
- Potatoes
- Greek Yogurt, plain
- Pepper
- Salt
- Paprika
- Italian seasoning 
- Cayenne
steps:
- I typically make a little container of "Potato spice" by combining a tbsp of each (maybe only 1/2 tbsp for Cayenne) of the spices. If you don't want to do that then I would probably use maybe like 1/2 tsp of each or maybe a tsp depending on how many Potatoes you use, but really save yourself the trouble and just make yourself a little "Potato Spice" jar so you can just grab and go. It's great for eggs, saute'd mushrooms and onions, you get my point.
- I like to use those little cute Potatoes becasue you can just half or quarter them and they are the perfect size, but if you are using full sized Potatoes aim to cut them into 1/4 inch chunks. 
- Now toss your Potato chunks into a pot with water and start boiling. Once boiled you want to take them out as soon as the middle gets soft. This doesn't take two long, probably about 5 minutes, especially if you have small chunks.
- You can deep fry them, roast them, or fry them, your choice. 
- To deep fry, oil at 350° and cook for about 5 mins, remove and place in strainer for a minute to have excess oil drip off, then toss in a bowl with your desired amount of spices. 
- To pan fry, I go med to med-high heat, toss the Potaotes in a bowl with oil and spices then toss in your frying pan. Let them sit for a couple of minutes each time before you stir. Keep doing so until the outer layer reaches desired crunchiness, careful though, easy to burn and if you stir it too much you'll notice your Potatoes will stick and break in your pan.
- To roast in the oven I set the temp to 400°. I toss the Potatoes in oil and spices and place skin side down on a greased baking tray. Place into oven for 10 minutes and check how crispy they are, let roast longer if needed.
- Whatever method you choose, when they are done move your portion to a bowl and add a tbsp or two of greek yogurt to the dish annd stir. Done.
