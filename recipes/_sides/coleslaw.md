title: No Mayo Coleslaw
picture: coleslaw
ingredients:
- 1 Small Cabbage
- 1 Carrot
- Half an onion or 1 small onion
- 1 tbsp of Celery Seed
- 1/2 cup of White Sugar
- 1 cup of Vinegar
- 2 tbsp of Olive Oil
- 1 tbsp of Salt
steps:
- Take your cabbage and either chop it up as thin as you want it or use a mandolin.
- Shred/Julian Carrots. I find the large option on a cheese grater works well.
- Either finely slice your onion or use the mandolin you used on your cabbage.
- Combine everything in a large container and mix well.

Fresh and crunchy bite I find it goes swimmingly on a hotdog or with fried fish.
