I"<p>I’m not a fan of adding chicken to a caeser salad, fish makes way more sense to me and I don’t think meat should really be in a mixed green or house salad, but I don’t necessarily hate the idea of chicken and lettuce if done in a way that makes sense. The key here is using a dressing that actually goes with your chicken (check sauces for curry or honey mustard dressing) and using toppings you would typically find in a waldorf salad or an actual chicken salad, but ditching the mayonnaise based dressing.</p>

<p>One of the key things to do with making any salad is to dress the lettuce just before you add your toppings.</p>
