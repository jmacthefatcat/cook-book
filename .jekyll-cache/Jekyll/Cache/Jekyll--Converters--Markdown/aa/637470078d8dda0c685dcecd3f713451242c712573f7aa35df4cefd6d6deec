I"c<p>Cheddar is king when it comes to this dish. If you can only have one type of cheese, I would recommend cheddar, that being said Iâ€™m not your mother and you can use whatever cheeses your heart desires.</p>

<p>Despite the name being Macaroni and Cheese, I find myself preferring small shell pasta instead - which you can see in the picture below.</p>
