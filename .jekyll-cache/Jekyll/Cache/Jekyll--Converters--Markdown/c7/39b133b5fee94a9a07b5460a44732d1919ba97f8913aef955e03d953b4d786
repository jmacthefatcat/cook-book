I"&<p>You want your crumble topping to be on the doughier side. If you find it’s still pretty “dusty” or simply still resembles flour, add more butter.</p>

<p>Your apples should also pile up and ideally be higher than your baking dish. If you use 5-6 apples and they don’t rise higher than the dish, try finding a smaller dish to bake the crumble in or just add more apple.</p>

<p>Walnuts (pecans or cashews work, or hell, use all three you little go getter) make a nice garnish when serving, goes extremely well with chocolate ice cream.</p>
