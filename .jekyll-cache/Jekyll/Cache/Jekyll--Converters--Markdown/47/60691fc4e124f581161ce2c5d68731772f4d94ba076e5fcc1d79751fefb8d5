I"ì<p>This coleslaw isnâ€™t mayonnaise based. I prefer this for itâ€™s fresh and crunchy bite and I find it goes swimmingly on a hotdog or with fried fish.</p>

<p>I would recommend only using Half the cabbage first as this tends to make a lot for just one person. I also tend to drain the coleslaw after itâ€™s had some time to sit in itâ€™s juices to avoid it getting super soggy. You can keep the left over sugar/vinegar juice if you want to add some to revive the taste at a later date.</p>
